# Definitions

## Filters/Kernels
- It is matrix of weights which undergoes scalar multiplication with input pixels to form "hopefully meaningful" pixel.  
## Epochs
- The number of times the convolution neural network crunches the whole dataset.
## 1x1 Convolution
-  It scalar multiplication of a channel with a number. Joins the channels which are contextually linked together.
## 3x3 Convolution
- A method to approximate 9 pixels at a time to know what they aggregately contain and representing the result with 1 number.
## Feature Maps
- Set of all related features which combine together to make a uniquely recognizable entity.
## Activation Function
- Weighted sum of inputs when added with a bias, goes through a check if value passes the threshold or not(fire or not-fire). 
## Receptive Field
- Receptive Fields are the area of attention for the output image which it can have on the input image.
